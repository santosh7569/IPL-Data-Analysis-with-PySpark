# IPL Data Analysis with PySpark

This project demonstrates data analysis of IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket matches using Apache Spark. The notebook explores various aspects of IPL data, including player performance, team statistics, and powerplay insights, leveraging PySpark for scalable data processing.

## Key Features

- **Schema Definition**: Implements detailed PySpark schemas for loading structured IPL data.
- **Data Processing**: Uses PySpark DataFrame operations for cleaning and transforming cricket data.
- **Insights Generation**:
  - Most economical bowlers during powerplay overs.
  - Player-specific and team-based performance metrics.
- **Visualization**: Generates insightful plots to highlight key findings.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Python 3.7 or later  
- **PySpark**: Apache Spark 3.x  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running the `.ipynb` file  
- **Additional Libraries**: Matplotlib (for data visualization)
